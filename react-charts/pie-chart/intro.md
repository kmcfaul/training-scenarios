PatternFly React charts are based on the [Victory chart](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/) library, along with additional functionality, custom components, and theming for PatternFly.

PatternFly provides a collection of React-based components that are used to build patterns with consistent markup, styling, and behavior.

PatternFly React charts are composed using separate components, so features are more easily customizable. This course covers PatternFly pie charts starting with a simple chart, tooltips, a legend, and concluding by changing the theme color.
