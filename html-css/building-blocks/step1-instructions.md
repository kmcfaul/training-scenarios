In PatternFly, components which cannot be broken down into smaller parts are known as the basic building blocks of user interfaces. Examples include the button, label and badge components.

In this step, add a button component.

Katacoda is setting up a new application. Begin coding once the server starts and "Welcome to PatternFly" appears on the lower pane.

1) <strong>Copy code into the `index.html` file.</strong>

Click the `Copy to Editor` button below to add HTML for a `button` component to the `index.html` file.

<pre class="file" data-filename="index.html" data-target="replace">
&lt;button class=&quot;pf-c-button pf-m-primary&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;
  Primary
&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>

2) <strong>Add one more `button` component.</strong>

Click the `Copy to Editor` button below to add HTML for two `button` components to the `index.html` file.

<pre class="file" data-filename="index.html" data-target="replace">
&lt;button class=&quot;pf-c-button pf-m-primary&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;
  Primary
&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class=&quot;pf-c-button pf-m-primary&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;
  Primary
&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>
