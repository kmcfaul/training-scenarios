In PatternFly, layouts are the containers that allow for organizing and grouping elements.

Use layouts instead of writing custom CSS, as they allow components to remain modularby handling the styles necessary to position components in different contexts. Note that layout styles should never be part of a component.

This module will cover PatternFly's sevel different layouts: bullseye, flex, gallery, grid, level, split and stack.
